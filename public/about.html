      <p>The aim behind this website is to raise awareness, understanding, and support for people struggling all over the world. The only way to acheive this aim is to remainn proactive, and do what we can with our given skills to assist people who cannot assist themselves at this point in time. Be it homeless Americans, Syrian Refugees, or people impacted by a brutal natrual disaster, I beleive that simple words of kindness are powerful catlysts of change and optimism. 
     <br><br>
     Any and all requests for assistance and support, no matter what kind, will be taken seriously and addressed promptly. I'll do my best to make sure whatever resources you may need are at your disposal. Our goal is to directly impact the lives of people in difficult circumstances all over the world through the messages collected on this site, as well as the donations that will be collected once a large enough following is developed. The intention is to completely cut out the middleman and avoid the bueracracy that seems to muddle the impact of many other charitable causes, but this is only possible if we can democratize our mediums of connection, and create a direct pipeline between the source and the destination. In the end, I hope to inspire people to join this mission, and perhaps even take on their own missions of a similar nature. <i>We have to innovate inclusively as opposed to exclusively, and lend a helping hand to those who need it most.</i>
     <br><br>
     This is an <i>open sourced project</i>, and will be modified, moderated, and upgraded as demand and interest peaks.
     <br><br>
     <b>Feedback is both welcomed and encouraged.</b>

          <div class="elegant-aero"><h1 id="lolol"><center>Get involved?</center></h1>
      <p>If you would like to get involved, you can shoot me a message through my <a href="contact.html">contact form</a> or shoot me a <a href="https://twitter.com/leonmatic">tweet</a>. I will do my best to get back to you as soon as possible. 
      <br><br>
      When you do contact me with the intention to get involved, I only ask that you specify your name, contact information (email or twitter will suffice), and the capacity at which you would like to be involved (i.e, technically involved in managing the site, financially involved in helping to strategize our donation collection scaling strategy, or if you simply would like to be a representative). Any and all help is greatly appreciated!
      <br>
      <br>
      If you know someone, a group, or an organization that would like to get involved, please feel free to provide me with their contact infomation, or have them contact me. This is currently a one man operation and I don't beleive it's smart to assume that I will be able to handle the responsibilites of <i>Hunamity Outrach</i> once the following matures and expands. Any future assistance from developers, entrepreneurs, and anybody with experience in the non-profit/charitable sector will be a huge contribution to this endeavor.
